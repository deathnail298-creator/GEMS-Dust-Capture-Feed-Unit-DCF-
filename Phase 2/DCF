2.1 Purpose of Phase 2

Phase 2 exists to document theoretical extensions and variations of the Phase 0 / Phase 1 DCF concept.

Phase 2 content is reasoning-only. It does not modify Phase 0 or Phase 1 scope, does not add claims, and does not authorize execution, fabrication, testing, or deployment.

2.2 Example Areas of Theoretical Exploration (Non-Exhaustive)

The following areas may be explored conceptually, without validation or commitment:

Alternate passive inlet or capture geometries

Material substitutions based on abrasion resistance or availability

Placement strategies relative to traffic patterns and activity zones

Variations in manual emptying approaches

Passive interface concepts for downstream handling systems

These items are illustrative only and are not requirements, recommendations, or guarantees.

2.3 Explicit Non-Claims

Phase 2 makes no claims regarding:

Performance improvements

Capture efficiency

Environmental behavior

Operational effectiveness

Lifetime, maintenance, or scaling

Readiness level or mission suitability

No modeling, simulation, or testing is implied.

2.4 Status

Reasoning-only

No execution authorization

No TRL advancement

No modification of Phase 0 / Phase 1

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 lists possible theoretical variations of the DCF without changing its scope or authorizing action. It exists only to capture ideas for reasoning, not to make claims or commitments.
