3.1 Purpose of Phase 3

Phase 3 defines the commercial and execution boundary for DCF material beyond Phase 1.

Phase 3 is administrative in nature. It introduces no technical content and does not modify Phase 0, Phase 1, or Phase 2.

3.2 Boundary Definition

Phase 0 and Phase 1 content may be read, reviewed, evaluated, and discussed freely

Phase 2 content may be read and reasoned about freely

Any execution beyond Phase 1 requires a paid execution license

Execution includes, but is not limited to:

Fabrication

Testing beyond Phase 1 scope

Integration with other systems

Deployment

Derivative implementation based on Phase 2 concepts

3.3 Execution License (Summary)

License Type: Execution License

Scope: Authorizes execution of Phase 2 concepts or work beyond Phase 1

Fee: $5,000 USD

Applicability: Per organization or per project

Structure: Uniform across repositories in this catalog

Reading, evaluation, and internal discussion remain unrestricted.

3.4 What Phase 3 Is Not

Phase 3 is not:

A roadmap

A production plan

A performance guarantee

A commercialization promise

An obligation to execute

3.5 Status

Boundary-setting only

Predictable, uniform, and non-negotiated

Identical structural role to Phase 3 sections in other repositories

Plain-English Summary

Phase 3 defines where reasoning ends and execution begins for the DCF. Reading and evaluation are free, but building, testing beyond Phase 1, or implementing Phase 2 concepts requires a standard $5,000 execution license. It exists only to clarify boundaries, not to add new claims.
