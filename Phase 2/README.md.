Phase 2 — Theory / Non-Executable Extensions
Purpose

Phase 2 documents theoretical extensions and variations of the DCF concept for reasoning and evaluation only.

Phase 2 does not modify Phase 0 or Phase 1, adds no claims, and authorizes no execution. It exists to capture ideas without commitment.

Scope of Phase 2

Phase 2 may include conceptual consideration of:

Alternate passive capture geometries

Material substitutions based on abrasion tolerance or availability

Placement strategies relative to traffic patterns and activity zones

Variations in manual emptying approaches

Passive interface concepts for downstream handling systems

These items are illustrative only. They are not requirements, recommendations, or guarantees.

Explicit Non-Claims

Phase 2 makes no claims regarding:

Performance or efficiency

Environmental behavior

Operational effectiveness

Lifetime, maintenance, or scaling

Mission readiness or suitability

Technology readiness level (TRL)

No modeling, simulation, fabrication, or testing is implied.

Execution Boundary

Phase 2 content is reasoning-only.

Any fabrication, testing beyond Phase 1, integration, deployment, or derivative implementation informed by Phase 2 concepts requires a paid execution license as defined in Phase 3.
