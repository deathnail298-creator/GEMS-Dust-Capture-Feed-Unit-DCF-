For a passive dust interception unit such as the DCF, typical internal costs may include:

Engineering time to define scope, non-claims, and interfaces

Internal review cycles to ensure the concept does not imply unintended obligations

Legal or procurement review to establish execution boundaries

Documentation sufficient to justify limited prototyping or evaluation

Even at minimal scope, these activities commonly exceed $20,000–$50,000 USD in internal labor and overhead before any physical testing occurs.

Estimated Internal Cost vs License

Best-case internal cost ≈ $5k

Typical internal cost ≈ $7k–$10k

License = $5k, fixed

The $5,000 execution license associated with Phase 3 is intended to:

Eliminate internal re-derivation of scope and boundaries

Reduce review and approval friction

Provide a ready-made, low-risk reference suitable for evaluation or limited execution

The license does not represent the “value” of the hardware itself.
It represents cost avoidance and predictability in early-stage decision-making.

Plain-English Executive Summary

The license costs less than the internal effort most organizations spend just deciding how to talk about a simple concept. It exists to save time and reduce friction, not to sell the bucket.
