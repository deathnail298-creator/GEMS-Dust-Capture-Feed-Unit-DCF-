0.1 Purpose

The GEMS Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) is a passive, always-open dust interception container intended to capture already-airborne or already-loose lunar regolith dust in high-traffic areas (pads, corridors, activity zones), and to hold it for manual handling and downstream routing (e.g., GEMS input, slag processing input, or disposal).

DCF does not prevent dust creation. It is an interception and collection container.

0.2 What It Is

DCF is a static dust capture and staging unit consisting of:

A passive, always-open capture geometry (mouth / inlet / baffle) that allows dust to enter

A gravity-fed hopper / bin volume for holding captured dust

A manual emptying or manual transfer interface (bag-out, dump, scoop, etc.)

Optional passive interfaces for downstream equipment connection (physical docking or alignment surfaces only)

DCF may be deployed as a standalone field asset or as a “site furniture” component used repeatedly.

0.3 What It Is Not (Non-Claims)

DCF is not:

An active vacuum system (no suction, fans, pumps)

A dust suppression system (no plume control claims)

A filtration system (no particle-size separation claims)

A powered system (no power requirement)

A sensing system (no sensors, no telemetry, no automation)

A continuous transfer device (no continuous conveyance)

A sealing or pressurizing system

A safety-certified containment guarantee (no “zero leak” claim)

DCF makes no claim of eliminating dust, preventing dust exposure, or achieving any specific cleanliness standard.

0.4 System Boundaries & Ownership

DCF scope includes only:

Passive capture geometry

Passive storage volume (hopper/bin)

Passive structural elements and mounting features

Passive manual handling features (latches, handles, bag hooks, etc. — no powered actuation)

DCF scope explicitly excludes:

Any powered extraction

Any robotics or autonomous handling

Any environmental control (thermal, pressurized enclosure, purging)

Any guarantees about downstream processing performance

Downstream systems (GEMS, slag processing, disposal hardware) are out of scope and remain the responsibility of their owners.

0.5 Operating Context

DCF is intended for deployment in lunar surface environments where dust is mobilized by:

Foot traffic

Rover traffic

Local activity near pads/corridors

General site operations

DCF is positioned to intercept dust that is already moving through the site, with emphasis on low-complexity, high-survivability site infrastructure.

0.6 Phase 0 Success Criteria

Phase 0 is successful if the DCF concept is unambiguous and bounded:

The purpose is clear: intercept and stage already-mobile dust

The unit is clearly passive: no power, no sensors, no moving parts required

Interfaces and exclusions are explicit enough that the concept cannot be misread as a full dust mitigation solution

The scope is small enough to be realistically prototype-testable in Phase 1

0.7 Primary Risks (Acknowledged, Not Solved in Phase 0)

Dust may not preferentially enter the capture geometry without favorable placement

Overfilling / clogging behavior depends on geometry and operating patterns

Manual emptying may be messy or ergonomically poor without careful design

Windless lunar environment means dust transport patterns may be highly localized and activity-driven

These are Phase 1 questions, not Phase 0 claims.

Plain-English Summary

The DCF is a passive “space bucket” intended to intercept and hold dust that is already airborne or already loose in high-traffic lunar areas. It does not claim to stop dust from being created or to actively remove it. Phase 0 only defines the concept, boundaries, and non-claims clearly enough to justify a bounded Phase 1 test.
