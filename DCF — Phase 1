1.1 Purpose of Phase 1

Phase 1 exists to define a bounded, non-optimizing prototype and test scope for the GEMS Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF).

Phase 1 authorizes limited physical testing to answer basic feasibility questions about passive dust interception, handling, and survivability. It does not authorize scaling, operational deployment, or integration into mission-critical systems.

1.2 Phase 1 Prototype Definition (Bounded)

A Phase 1 DCF prototype consists of:

A fixed, passive capture geometry (mouth / inlet / baffle)

A gravity-fed storage volume (hopper or bin)

A manual emptying interface (dump, scoop, or bag-out)

Structural mounting suitable for static placement

Constraints:

No power

No sensors

No active flow control

No moving parts required for capture

No automation

Multiple prototype geometries may be fabricated only to compare passive performance, not to optimize or finalize a design.

1.3 Authorized Phase 1 Test Activities

Phase 1 testing is limited to:

Capture feasibility testing

Does dust enter and remain in the container under representative disturbance?

Geometry comparison

Relative performance of different passive inlet shapes

Filling behavior

Accumulation rate, bridging, clogging, and overflow tendencies

Manual handling evaluation

Ease and messiness of emptying

Ergonomic considerations

Survivability testing

Abrasion

Structural robustness

Dust fouling of passive features

Testing may be conducted in:

Laboratory simulants

Analog environments

Controlled field tests

No vacuum, thermal, or long-duration environmental qualification is implied.

1.4 Explicit Phase 1 Exclusions

Phase 1 does not include:

Performance guarantees or targets

Dust suppression effectiveness claims

Continuous or automated transfer

Integration with GEMS or other downstream systems

Environmental sealing or pressurization

Lifetime or maintenance modeling

Scaling analysis

Mission readiness or TRL advancement beyond basic feasibility

Any such activities are explicitly out of scope.

1.5 Phase 1 Success Criteria

Phase 1 is considered successful if:

Passive capture of already-mobile dust is demonstrated under test conditions

Dust can be manually removed without catastrophic loss or excessive complexity

No active systems are required for basic function

Failure modes (clogging, spillover, abrasion) are observable and understandable

The concept remains mechanically simple and robust

Success does not require high efficiency, optimization, or operational endorsement.

1.6 Phase 1 Termination / Kill Criteria

Phase 1 should be terminated if:

Passive capture is negligible regardless of placement or geometry

Dust consistently re-aerosolizes or escapes during normal handling

The design requires active assistance to function

Manual handling is unacceptably unsafe or impractical

Survivability issues render the concept non-viable even at small scale

Termination is a valid Phase 1 outcome.

1.7 Phase 1 Status

Prototype-level only

Test and observe, not optimize

No downstream commitments

No implied deployment

Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 authorizes small, passive prototypes of the DCF to test whether a simple “space bucket” can intercept and hold already-mobile dust and be manually emptied. It deliberately avoids optimization, automation, or operational claims and exists only to decide whether the concept is viable at all.
