GEMS Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF)
Overview

The GEMS Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) is a passive, always-open dust interception unit designed to capture already-airborne lunar dust generated by routine surface activity and gravity-feed it into a small hopper for manual transfer to downstream systems such as GEMS.

DCF is not a dust suppression system. It does not prevent dust creation. It intercepts dust that is already moving.

What This Is

DCF is a primitive, infrastructure-grade dust interceptor intended for placement in high-traffic or high-disturbance areas where dust is already present and mobile.

It is designed to:

Intercept ambient dust in motion from routine activity (crew movement, rover traffic, handling operations, post-event drift)

Passively collect that dust without power, sensors, or moving parts

Provide a simple gravity-fed hopper that can be manually emptied into a downstream process

DCF is intentionally simple. All complexity is pushed downstream.

What This Is Not (Non-Claims)

DCF explicitly does not:

Mitigate launch plumes or alter ejecta physics

Prevent dust generation

Clean suits, seals, optics, radiators, solar panels, or mechanisms

Act as a vacuum, HVAC filter, or air handling system

Use suction, fans, electrostatics, sensors, or automation

Provide continuous transfer, metering, or autonomous routing

Guarantee particle size, purity, dryness, or contamination control

Provide sample chain-of-custody or certification

If dust suppression, cleanliness guarantees, or automation are required, they belong to other systems — not DCF.

Operational Context

DCF units are intended to be distributed, not centralized.

Typical placements include:

Pad perimeters (for post-event drifting dust, not plume control)

Corridors and high-traffic paths

Activity zones such as suitports, unloading areas, and staging points

Regolith handling and processing areas

Each unit operates independently and requires no coordination with other units.

System Behavior (How It Works)

An always-open passive capture geometry presents a dead-end path that already-moving dust preferentially enters

Dust settles into a gravity-fed hopper with no valves, doors, or actuators

The hopper is manually emptied into a container or directly into a downstream system

There are no powered states, no modes, and no control logic.

Interfaces

DCF ends at a manual dust handoff point.

Supported downstream uses include:

GEMS feed (primary)

Slag Maker feed (secondary)

Disposal or containment (tertiary)

All requirements for screening, purification, sterilization, or processing belong entirely to the downstream system.

Phase 0 Scope (Permission to Exist)

Phase 0 establishes that DCF is a defensible, buildable concept.

Phase 0 success criteria:

Passive capture geometry is physically plausible for intercepting already-moving dust

Gravity hopper behavior is credible and serviceable

Interface boundaries keep DCF simple and non-entangling

No performance guarantees are made in Phase 0.

Phase 1 Scope (Permission to Test)

Phase 1 testing is intentionally bounded.

Included tests:

Capture effectiveness across representative placement scenarios

Hopper fill behavior, including bridging and clogging tendencies

Abrasion and wear of capture surfaces

Manual servicing ergonomics (glove use, spill risk, service time)

Explicit exclusions (still out of scope):

Active suction or electrostatic systems

Sensors, automation, or continuous transfer

Dust suppression or plume mitigation claims

Phase 1 Termination / Kill Criteria

Phase 1 testing is terminated if:

Chronic clogging or bridging cannot be resolved with passive geometry changes

Capture effectiveness is too low to justify emplacement footprint

Manual servicing becomes a crew burden

Wear rates require complex mitigation rather than simple sacrificial elements

DCF is expected to fail fast if it is not useful.

Plain-English Summary

DCF is a passive box that catches dust that is already moving and lets crews dump it into another system.
It does not stop dust from being made and does not clean anything.
If you want to build or use it, you need a license.
